# 5x Effective Relics

Mod by andr9528 (GitHub) / WolfDK (Discord) / BlueishTiger (Steam).

## Description

Multiplies the effectiveness of relics by 5.
If the effect would be at or above 100%, it will only be 99%, as a number of relics bugs out the game somewhat at 100%+.

The Mod is an Additive Data Mod, so it should be compatible with any other 'techtree' altering mod.
If some other mod changes the relics effects, prior to this loading, then relics might end up with additional effects.

## Issues

Should any issues be found, fell free to create an issue on the GitHub Page <https://github.com/andr9528/Retold-Mods>.

If you find that one or more relics does not appear to be affected by this mod, then those relics might

1. Be newer than this mod.
2. Be added by some other mod you have.

In any case, do let me know, and i will see if i can add them to this.
